## Conference Papers

### Algorithmic Approach for producing Agamographs
*OCIT-2024, 22nd OITS International Conference on Information Technology*  
**Arkopal Das**

This paper presents a novel algorithmic approach for automatically generating Agamographs - artworks that display different images when viewed from different angles. The research focuses on computational methods for creating these visual illusions efficiently.

## Research Reports

### Mathematical Art Generation Using Algorithmic Approaches
*Research Report, CCL IIT Gandhinagar, June 2023*  
**Arkopal Das**, under the guidance of Prof. Jay Thakkar

This research report documents algorithms and implementations for producing mathematical art as part of STEM education. The report details methods for creating images using pins and Rubik's Cube, and techniques for mutually constraining two images using two faces of a stack of Rubik's Cubes.

## Upcoming Work

*I am currently working on new research papers exploring the intersection of algorithms and mathematical art. Details will be posted here when available.*
