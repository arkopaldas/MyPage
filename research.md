# Research Interests

My research focuses on several exciting areas in computer science. I am particularly interested in:

- Graph Algorithms and their applications
- Artificial Intelligence
- NP Completeness and computational complexity
- Quantum Computing
- Algorithmic approaches to creating mathematical art
- Computational methods in visual arts

## Current Research

### Algorithmic Approach for producing Agamographs
*Presented at OCIT-2024, 22nd OITS International Conference on Information Technology*

This research explores algorithmic methods for creating Agamographs - artworks that change appearance when viewed from different angles. My work focuses on developing efficient algorithms that can automatically generate these complex visual structures.

## Past Research

### Mathematical Art Project
*Research Internship at CCL IIT Gandhinagar (June 2023)*  
*Under the guidance of Prof. Jay Thakkar*

During this research internship, I focused on:

- Devising algorithms to produce mathematical art as part of STEM education
- Creating images using pins and Rubik's Cube as initial components
- Developing methods to mutually constrain two images and producing them using two faces of a stack of Rubik's Cubes

## Research Philosophy

I believe in the power of interdisciplinary approaches, particularly the union of mathematics, computer science, and art. My goal is to develop computational methods that can enhance creativity and educational experiences, while also advancing our understanding of algorithms and their applications in non-traditional domains.
